### Linear Regression with a Randomly Censored Covariate

***censCov*** consists of implementations of threshold regression approaches for linear regression models with a covariate subject to random censoring, including deletion threshold regression and completion threshold regression. Reverse survival regression, which flip the role of response variable and the covariate, is also considered.

### Installation

``` r
install.packages("censCov")
library(censCov)
```

You can install `censCov` from github with:
