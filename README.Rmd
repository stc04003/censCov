### Linear Regression with a Randomly Censored Covariate
***censCov*** consists of implementations of threshold regression approaches for linear regression models with a covariate subject to random censoring, including deletion threshold regression and completion threshold regression. Reverse survival regression, which flip the role of response variable and the covariate, is also considered.

### Installation

You can install and load **censCov** from CRAN using

```{r cran-installation, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("censCov")
library(censCov)
```

You can install `censCov` from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
## install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("stc04003/censCov")
```

### Getting Started
The package [vignette](https://www.sychiou.com/censCov/index.html) provides a quick demonstration for the basic usage of the main functions.
